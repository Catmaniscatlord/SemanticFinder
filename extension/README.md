# Transformers.js - Sample browser extension

An example project to show how to run ðŸ¤— Transformers in a browser extension. Although we only provide instructions for running in Chrome, it should be similar for other browsers.

## Getting Started
1. Install the necessary dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install 
    ```

2. Build the project:
    ```bash
    npm run build 
    ```
   or
    ```bash
    npm run dev 
    ```
   for auto-reload. 

3. Add the extension to your browser. To do this, go to `chrome://extensions/`, enable developer mode (top right), and click "Load unpacked". Select the `build` directory from the dialog which appears and click "Select Folder".
